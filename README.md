# PHP-Object-Oriented-Programming
LinkedIn course of PHP: OOP.PHP developers can benefit from the efficient, well-organized, reusable, and easy-to-understand code that object-oriented programming offers. In this intermediate-level course, Kevin Skoglund introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for PHP. Kevin shows how to define a class, add properties and methods, and create new instances. He demonstrates how to use class inheritance to share, extend, and override class behavior, and how to control access to the properties and methods of a class. He explains the difference between static and late static bindings, and shows how to customize the PHP "magic" methods, which are triggered automatically. In the final chapter, he shows how to add object-oriented code to a real-world PHP website, so you can see OOP techniques in action.
